## **Reflection**

As an attendee of this industry talk, I felt inspired from hearing experiences shared by the speakers and the guidance they offered. The session not only laid out a path for developing both technical and management skills but also highlighted the importance of soft skills, adaptability, and ongoing education.

It became clear to me that achieving success involves a blend of technical knowledge, personal growth, and a proactive attitude. By embracing these ideas, students like myself can aim for excellence and forge meaningful careers that reflect our interests and strengths.

This session provided a valuable chance to consider the essential actions needed for career advancement. I'm thankful for the speakers' openness in sharing their insights and experiences. Looking ahead, I feel better prepared to take intentional steps toward shaping my career and making a significant contribution to the industry.
